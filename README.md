# Non Fungible Pixels [NFP] ðŸ‘¾

<h1> What is an NFP? </h1>
  <p> NFP stands for "Non Fungible Pixels". This project is basically a trading game where you can buy, sell and trade pixel art to, in the end, make some profits. </p>
  
<h1> Why Am I Making this? </h1>
  <p> I for some reason enjoy trading and flipping goods to make a profit, but in most cases it takes some monetary investment to be able to start trading. I am making this platform in a way that monetary investment is not necessary to trade so that more people can enjoy trading without having to worry as much about losing money. </p>
  
<h1> How will the trading and flipping work? </h1>
  <p> You will be able to trade NFPs by using NFPs you own or by using the in-game currency which you can obtain by either selling art you made on the marketplace, selling art you own on the marketplace, trading art you own with other users for in-game currency or by grinding to get currency like in many other discord bots or purchasing currency from our site.
  
<h1> What is in it for artists? </h1>
  <p> Once you sign up as an artist, you will be able to post your work on the marketplace for it to be bought and sold. You will be receive a certain amount of in-game currency dpeneding on how much the peice of art is worth on the marketplace. If a user likes your art, they will be able to contact you to hire you as a freelancer. You can use your profile on this bot as a portfolio for your work. </p>
  
<h1> Development Updates </h1>
  <p> Development will start soon. </p>
